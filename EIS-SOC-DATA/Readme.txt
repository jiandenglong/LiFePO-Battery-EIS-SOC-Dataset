Dataset Description

1.Detailed experimental procedures and parameter settings of this open-source dataset are available in the paper:
State of Charge Estimation of LiFePO₄ Batteries based on Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy at Multi Temperatures

2.This dataset includes three categories of test experimental data, as specified below:
①Initial Characteristic Test：
It consists of data from 3 cycles of capacity tests and 1 cycle of Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) test.
②Temperature Test：
It contains Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) test data of 1 cycle under the temperatures of 10℃, 20℃, 25℃, 30℃ and 40℃.
EIS measurements were performed at every 4% State of Charge (SOC) interval during the test.
In the dataset files, T1_Segment_CH3 to T1_Segment(26)_CH3 correspond to EIS data at 100% to 0% SOC sequentially.
The voltage data refers to the real-time current and voltage monitoring data collected during this test cycle.
③Dynamic Test：
It covers test data under Dynamic Stress Test (DST) and Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) conditions.
EIS measurements were taken at regular time intervals during the test. The corresponding SOC values at each measurement moment need to be calculated based on the synchronously collected current and voltage data.
